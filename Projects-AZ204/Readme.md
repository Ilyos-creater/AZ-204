# AZ-204 Project-Based Learning

This directory will contain **hands-on projects** that I will build while learning for the **AZ-204: Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure** certification. These projects follow recommendations from [Made by GPS](https://github.com/madebygps/cloud-engineering-projects/blob/main/az-204/readme.md), providing real-world experience and reinforcing key concepts required for the exam.

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose
The goal of these projects is to:
- Gain **practical experience** in Azure development
- Apply **certification concepts** in real-world scenarios
